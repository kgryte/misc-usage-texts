Arithmetic Mean

Description

	Generic function for the (trimmed) arithmetic mean.

Usage

	mean(x, ...)

	## Default S3 method:
	mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)

Arguments

	x: An R object. Currently there are methods for numeric/logical vectors and date, date-time and time interval objects. Complex vectors are allowed for trim = 0, only.

	trim: the fraction (0 to 0.5) of observations to be trimmed from each end of x before the mean is computed. Values of trim outside that range are taken as the nearest endpoint.

	na.rm: a logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the computation proceeds.

	...: further arguments passed to or from other methods.

Value

	If trim is zero (the default), the arithmetic mean of the values in x is computed, as a numeric or complex vector of length one. If x is not logical (coerced to numeric), numeric (including integer) or complex, NA_real_ is returned, with a warning.

	If trim is non-zero, a symmetrically trimmed mean is computed with a fraction of trim observations deleted from each end before the mean is computed.
