  cov(v1[, v2][, vardim=1, corrected=true, mean=nothing])

  Compute the Pearson covariance between the vector(s) in v1 and v2. Here, v1
  and v2 can be either vectors or matrices.

  This function accepts three keyword arguments:

    •  vardim: the dimension of variables. When vardim = 1, variables are
      considered in columns while observations in rows; when vardim = 2,
      variables are in rows while observations in columns. By default, it is
      set to 1.
    •  corrected: whether to apply Bessel's correction (divide by n-1 instead
      of n). By default, it is set to true.
    •  mean: allow users to supply mean values that are known. By default, it
      is set to nothing, which indicates that the mean(s) are unknown, and the
      function will compute the mean. Users can use mean=0 to indicate that
      the input data are centered, and hence there's no need to subtract the
      mean.

  The size of the result depends on the size of v1 and v2. When both v1 and v2
  are vectors, it returns the covariance between them as a scalar. When either
  one is a matrix, it returns a covariance matrix of size (n1, n2), where n1 and
  n2 are the numbers of slices in v1 and v2, which depend on the setting of
  vardim.

  Note: v2 can be omitted, which indicates v2 = v1.
