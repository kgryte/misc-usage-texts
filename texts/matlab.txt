MONTECARLOPREDICTION
  Use Monte Carlo methods to generate a distribution of standard
  deviation (std) values observed from a binomial process (Bernoulli
  Trial) with a specified probability of success.

  INPUTS:
      EDGES: a vector defining the bin edges into which the simulated
      standard deviations will be histogrammed.

      EVENTS: the number of events (collections of trials) to be
      sampled from the distribution.

      TRIALS: the number of trials.

      PROBABILITY: the probability of success. For example, a series of
      coin flips is a collection of events characterized by Bernoulli
      trials with probability 0.5.

      ITERATIONS: the number of times to repeat each collection of events
      so as to arrive at an average value for the calculated standard
      deviations. Default: 500.


  OUTPUTS:
      STDDISTRIBUTION: a probability distribution of the standard
      deviation with support defined by EDGES. Output is a vector.
